### Description

In recent years Semantic Web based systems, applications and tools have shown significant improvement. Their increased deployment indicates a steady maturing of semantic technologies and demonstrates their value in solving current and emerging problems. Though the number of enterprises working on and with these technologies is dwarfed by the number who have not yet adopted semantic technologies. Possible reasons for this include lack of well known enterprise use cases and market dynamics in academia on the one hand, and lack of easy to use standard architectures, frameworks, and system design patterns on the other hand. 

The goal for the Workshop on Semantic Web Enterprise Adoption and Best Practice is to foster adoption of Semantic Web technologies by helping to further bridge the gap between industry and academia. Topics for presentation and discussion at the workshop include technical and usage-oriented issues. The workshop aims to cover all matters that help in shortening development and deployment time for an academic or a practitioner wishing to work with semantic technologies.

### Topics

Authors are invited to consider the following (non exhaustive) list of topics:

- Surveys or case studies on Semantic Web technology in enterprise systems
- Comparative studies on the evolution of Semantic Web adoption
- Semantic systems and architectures of methodologies for industrial challenges
- Semantic Web based implementations and design patterns for enterprise systems
- Enterprise platforms using Semantic Web technology as part of the workflow
- Semantic Big Data solutions addressing Volume, Velocity, Variety, and Veracity
- Architectural overviews for Semantic Web systems
- Design patterns for semantic technology architectures and algorithms
- System development methodologies as applied to semantic technologies
- Semantic toolkits for enterprise applications
- Surveys on identified best practices based on Semantic Web technology

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be creative.
A final goal is to provide future initiatives with the devised ideas and visions to stimulate innovation in this research area.

### Submissions

Contributions to the workshop can be made in the form of long research or experience papers, or short position papers. Both categories of submissions should adhere to the [LNCS format guidelines](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0) and be submitted in PDF format.

Long papers focus on studies, approaches, architectures, or tools demonstrating or suggesting best practices in Semantic Web technologies. Submissions in this category are recommended be no longer than 8 pages. Accepted authors are given a presentation time slot of 20 minutes, with 5 minutes Q&A.
Short position papers focus on novel ideas, R&D directions, and early work in areas related to the workshop topics. Submissions in this category are recommended to be no longer than 4 pages. Accepted authors are given a presentation time slot of 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes Q&A.

Additionally, authors of selected papers will be asked to participate in a panel discussion on improving adoption of Semantic Web technologies.

Contributions are submitted via EasyChair: [https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wasabi2013](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wasabi2013)
