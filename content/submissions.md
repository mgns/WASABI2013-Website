### Description

Current developments on the Web have been marked by the increased use and popularity of Linked Data and Web APIs. However, these two technologies remain mostly disjunct in terms of developing solutions and applications in an integrated way. Therefore, we aim to explore the possibilities of facilitating a better integration of Web APIs and Linked Data, thus enabling the harvesting and provisioning of data through applications and services on the Web. In particular, we focus on investigating how resources exposed via Web APIs can be used together with Web semantic data, as means for enabling a shared use and providing a basis for developing rich applications on top.

### Topics

- Surveys or case studies on Semantic Web technology in enterprise systems
- Comparative studies on the evolution of Semantic Web adoption
- Semantic systems and architectures of methodologies for industrial challenges
- Semantic Web based implementations and design patterns for enterprise systems
- Enterprise platforms using Semantic Web technology as part of the workflow
- Architectural overviews for Semantic Web systems
- Design patterns for semantic technology architectures and algorithms
- System development methods as applied to semantic technologies
- Semantic toolkits for enterprise applications
- Surveys on identified best practices based on Semantic Web technology

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be creative.
A final goal is to provide future initiatives with the devised ideas and visions to stimulate innovation in this research area.

### Submissions

We offer several opportunities to participate in WaSABi:

Short papers and long papers are accepted at the workshop.

- Long papers focus on surveys, new approaches, architectures, or tools demonstrating best practices in Semantic Web technologies. Submissions in this category are limited to 8 pages. Accepted authors are given a time slot of 15 minutes, followed by 5 minutes Q&A.
- Short papers or Position papers focus on novel ideas, visions or topics that raise discussion concerning the adoption of Semantic Web technologies. Submissions in this category are limited to 4 pages. Accepted authors are given a time slot of 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes Q&A or, depending on the topic, 10 minutes of shared panel discussion.

Your submission can be posted through [EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wasabi2013).
