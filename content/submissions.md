Who?
: people from the Semantic Web, ...

What?
: novel ideas, concepts, and applications that demonstrate best practices and enterprise adoption of Semantic Web technology

When?
: ISWC workshop on Oct 21/22, 2013 â€“ submission deadline: July 12, 2013

How?
: an interactive workshop with lots of discussion, accepted paper presentations and [keynote](/keynote/)

Where?
: Sydney, Australia at the [ISWC conference](http://iswc2013.semanticweb.org/)

### Description

The workshop aims to help and guide the conversation between the scientific research community and industry with an eye towards the establishment of specific best practices. A common observation in the delayed adoption of semantic technologies is a lack of well-established practices, architectures and workflows. Both research and industry communities can benefit from a discussion about use cases, user stories, practical development issues and design patterns.

### Topics

- Surveys or case studies on Semantic Web technology in enterprise systems
- Comparative studies on the evolution of Semantic Web adoption
- Semantic systems and architectures of methodologies for industrial challenges
- Semantic Web based implementations and design patterns for enterprise systems
- Enterprise platforms using Semantic Web technology as part of the workflow
- Architectural overviews for Semantic Web systems
- Design patterns for semantic technology architectures and algorithms
- System development methods as applied to semantic technologies
- Semantic toolkits for enterprise applications
- Surveys on identified best practices based on Semantic Web technology

The above list is not exhaustive and we therefore actively encourage participants to be creative.
A final goal is to provide future initiatives with the devised ideas and visions to stimulate innovation in this research area.

### Submissions

We offer several opportunities to participate in WaSABi:

Short papers and long papers are accepted at the workshop.

- Long papers focus on surveys, new approaches, architectures, or tools demonstrating best practices in Semantic Web technologies. Submissions in this category are limited to 8 pages. Accepted authors are given a time slot of 15 minutes, followed by 5 minutes Q&A.
- Short papers or Position papers focus on novel ideas, visions or topics that raise discussion concerning the adoption of Semantic Web technologies. Submissions in this category are limited to 4 pages. Accepted authors are given a time slot of 10 minutes, followed by 5 minutes Q&A or, depending on the topic, 10 minutes of shared panel discussion.

Your submission can be posted through [EasyChair](https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wasabi2013).

Accepted papers will be published as CEUR workshop proceedings. Selected papers will be included in a separate ISWC workshop papers volume.
